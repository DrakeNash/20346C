Module 4

Lab: Managing Clients
---------------------

Scenario

Despite Remi’s reservations about Office 365, the FastTrack Pilot has proceeded well. Justin’s excellent project management skills, combined with Heidi’s enthusiasm for the new technology, has generated positive feedback from the pilot users. Because the pilot has received enthusiastic support from the COO and no objections from the CEO, Alain Richer is hopeful that the company will adopt the new platform and move directly from the Pilot Phase to the Deploy Phase.

Before they enter the final phase of the pilot, Heidi has been asked to review the deployment options for Office 365 ProPlus, as well as the management options available with this software.

Objectives

To provide the students with practical experience of planning and deploying Office 365 ProPlus clients.

Lab Setup

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

Virtual machine: 20346C-LUC-CL1

Username: **Student2**

Password: **Pa$$w0rd**

In all tasks, where you see references to lucernepublishingXXXX.onmicrosoft.com, replace the XXXX with the unique Lucerne Publishing number that you were assigned when you set up your Office 365 account in Module 1, Lab 1B, Exercise 2, Task 3, Step 5.

Where you see references to labXXXXX.o365ready.com, replace the XXXXX with the unique O365ready.com number you were assigned when you registered your IP address at www.o365ready.com in Module 2, Lab 2B, Exercise 1, Task 2, Step 6.

### Exercise 1: Manage user-driven client deployments

Scenario

Lucerne Publishing plans to use a combination of user-driven and managed deployments, depending on the employment relationship and working practices of individual users. Associates, those who have brought their own devices, and home workers will all install Office 365 ProPlus manually from the Office 365 website. Heidi then wants to see what happens to users when she activates and deactivates Office 365 ProPlus subscriptions.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Managing Software and Licenses

2. Performing User-driven Installation

3. Deactivating Office 365 ProPlus

### Exercise 2: Manage IT deployments of Office 365 ProPlus

Scenario

For users who work on domain-joined computers at Lucerne Publishing office locations either in Switzerland or around the world, self-service deployment is not suitable. This restriction is due to the users’ lack of administrative rights, as well as the additional download traffic that would be generated. As a result, Heidi wants to analyze both group policy management and scripting to enable deployment of Office 365 to multiple computers within a managed network.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Using the Office Deployment Tool

2. Creating Deployment GPOs

3. Verifying a Managed Deployment

4. Using GPOs to Modify First Run Experience

####   Task 1: Using the Office Deployment Tool

In this step, you will back up the Office 15 **configuration.xml** file and then open it so that you can edit it in the next step. To do this, perform the following steps:

In File Explorer, double-click **C:\\Office15**.

As a best practice, you should back up configuration files before editing them; therefore, copy the **configuration.xml** file, paste it in this same folder, and then rename it so that you have a backup copy.

Right-click the **configuration.xml** file, click **Open with**, and then click **Notepad**.

In Notepad, replace all occurrences of **\\\\Server\\Share\\** with **\\\\LUC-SV1\\Office15\\**.

Comment out Visio to make the download quicker, by replacing this code:

\</Product\>

\<Language ID="en-us" /\>

\</Product\>

with this code:

\</Product\>

\<!--
