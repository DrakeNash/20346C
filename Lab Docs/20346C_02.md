Module 2

Lab A: Managing Users, Groups, and Licenses
-------------------------------------------

Scenario

Now that Heidi Leitner has set up a Lucerne Publishing trial tenant account and successfully registered the lucernepublishingXXXX.onmicrosoft.com domain, the company’s staff need to use the Office 365 interface during the pilot phase. As there has not yet been a decision on the final design, Heidi and the other Lucerne Publishing pilot users and IT staff are becoming familiar with the interface and the various administrative tasks. Chief among those tasks is the creation of users and groups, together with Office 365 and individual service license administration.

Objectives

To provide the students with practical experience of managing users, licenses, and groups by using both the Office 365 admin center and Windows PowerShell.

Lab Setup

Estimated Time: 75 minutes

Virtual machine: 20346C-LUC-CL1

Username: **Student1**

Password: **Pa$$w0rd**

Where you see references in the steps to lucernepublishingXXXX.onmicrosoft.com, you should replace XXXX with the unique Lucerne Publishing number that you entered when you set up your Office 365 accounts in Module 1, Lab 1B, Exercise 2, Task 3, Step 5.

Where you see references to labXXXXX.o365ready.com, you should replace XXXXX with the unique O365ready.com number you were assigned when you registered your IP address at www.o365ready.com in Module 2, Lab 2B, Exercise 1, Task 2, Step 6.

### Exercise 3: Manage Cloud Identities with Microsoft PowerShell

Scenario

Heidi is not a PowerShell expert, but she is determined to become more familiar with it and find out how it can help automate the processes of administering Office 365 user and group accounts. The Pilot Phase of the FastTrack process is a good time to learn these new skills and PowerShell syntax.

PowerShell Tip

Throughout this course, you will be tasked with entering a number of PowerShell commands. If you are able to work from a digital version of the course manual during the lab exercises and you are running virtual machines in Hyper-V, you can leverage the Hyper-V clipboard integration feature to paste commands. This will not only save you a lot of time and effort, but it will minimize potential errors should you accidentally mistype command strings.

Perform the following steps to copy and paste PowerShell commands using the Hyper-V clipboard integration feature:

1.  Highlight and right-click the command that you must enter in the lab.

Click **Copy**.

From the virtual machine menu bar, click **Clipboard**, and then click **Type clipboard text.**

### Lab Discussion Questions

| ![](media/image2.png) |
|-----------------------|

*What process do you need to go through before you can use PowerShell to administer users and groups in Office 365?*

Run Windows Azure Active Directory PowerShell with administrative rights, then execute the Connect-MSOL command. Provide the credentials of an account that has Global Admin or User Management Admin rights.

*How would you design your group structure to minimize adding and removing people from groups?*

Use nested groups and assign permissions to the group rather than to individuals.
