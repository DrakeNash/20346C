Module 3

Lab: Administering Office 365
-----------------------------

Scenario

Lucerne Publishing is now well into the Pilot Phase of its FastTrack deployment of Office 365. Justin has asked Heidi to review how administrator accounts are created. In addition, because the company is increasingly seeing its publications plagiarized or stolen outright, it needs to implement RMS in Office 365 to protect its intellectual property. However, Justin needs to ensure that they still have the ability to recover documents if required.

Objectives

To provide the students with practical experience of administering Office 365 administrator roles, passwords and password policies, and rights management by using both the Office 365 admin center and Windows PowerShell.

Lab Setup

Estimated Time: 75 minutes

Virtual machine: 20346C-LUC-CL1

Username: **Student1**

Password: **Pa$$w0rd**

In all tasks, where you see references to **lucernepublishingXXXX.onmicrosoft.com**, replace the **XXXX** with the unique Lucerne Publishing number that you were assigned when you set up your Office 365 account in Module 1, Lab 1B, Exercise 2, Task 3, Step 5.

### Exercise 2: Configure Password Management

Scenario

Justin does not want Office 365 password resets to burden the Helpdesk; therefore, he is concerned about the approach that the team is taking to password management in Office 365. He works with Heidi to find out how easy the process is for resetting passwords on his own account.

In discussions with Remi, Justin and Heidi have decided to implement the same password policy in Office 365 as they have in the internal network; this involves a password lifetime of 90 days and a notification period of 14 days prior to the change. Heidi is tasked to set up this policy and to discover how the company can use Windows Azure Active Directory Module for PowerShell to set and manage user passwords.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configuring the Password Expiration Policy

2. Resetting an Administrator Password

At the prompt, type the following command and press Enter:

Connect-msolservice

In the **Enter Credentials** dialog box, log in as **hleitner@lucernepublishing*XXXX*.onmicrosoft.com** (where XXXX is your unique Lucerne Publishing number) with a password of **Pa$$w0rd**.

At the prompt, type the following command and press Enter (where XXXX is your unique Lucerne Publishing number):

Set-MsolPasswordPolicy -DomainName “lucernepublishing*XXXX*.onmicrosoft.com” –ValidityPeriod “90” -NotificationDays “14”

At the prompt, type the following command and press Enter (where XXXX is your unique Lucerne Publishing number):

Set-MsolUserPassword –UserPrincipalName “tlanctot@lucernepublishing*XXXX*.onmicrosoft.com” –NewPassword “L3tme!nNow”

At the prompt, type the following command and press Enter:
